# Travel Hub

## Purpose
People love to travel, but it’s been hard given that we’re currently living through a global pandemic. Wouldn’t it be great to be able to find flight information and covid-19 restrictions all in one place? That’s what Travel Hub is for. A site to find flights and the covid-19 status of the location you would be flying into.
